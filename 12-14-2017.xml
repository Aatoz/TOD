					<p>When I prayed for her heart, she fell to the ground, then the translator suggested that I pray for her foot as well while she was laying there. I prayed for her foot. Then a few minutes later she got up, she praised God for being healed. She told us she felt electricity in her chest and that she could not feel her leg. I was encouraged by how God moved on her and how I was able to be a vessel for her healing. God is good!</p>
