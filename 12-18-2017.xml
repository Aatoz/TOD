				<p>The Lord gave me a word of knowledge about someone having a heart problem and also a left foot problem. Afterwards, a lady came up to me who had both conditions. </p>

					<p>When I prayed for her heart, she fell to the ground, then the translator suggested that I pray for her foot as well while she was laying there. I prayed for her foot. Then a few minutes later she got up, she praised God for being healed. She told us she felt electricity in her chest and that she could not feel her leg. I was encouraged by how God moved on her and how I was able to be a vessel for her healing. God is good!</p>
					<p>I prayed for a woman for fibromyalgia and she said that the Lord healed her.</p>

				<p>I had a word of knowledge for pain in right knee for past two years. A guy came up who had a problem for past two years because of a soccer injury. I prayed for him and he said he forgave the person who caused the injury and then he said he felt much better.</p>
